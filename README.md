Very simple data visualization project using kaggle data set, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales
for my video game sales information. The goal was to quantify the marketability of game genres through measuring rank and sales of 
individual video games and tie it back to what genre they all under. The visual at the end showcases how well video game genres
have performed over the years represented in the data.
